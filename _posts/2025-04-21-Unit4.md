# Unit 4: Iteration – AP Computer Science A

## 🔑 Key Concepts

- `for` loops
- `while` loops
- `do-while` loops
- Infinite loops and off-by-one errors
- Nested loops
- Loop control: `break` and `continue`

---

## 🔁 `for` Loop

Best for when the number of iterations is known.

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
}
// prints 0 to 4
```

---

## 🔁 `while` Loop

Best for when the number of iterations is unknown.

```java
int i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
}
```

---

## 🔁 `do-while` Loop

Runs the loop **at least once** before checking the condition.

```java
int i = 0;
do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
} while (i < 5);
```

---

## ⚠️ Infinite Loops

Loops that never terminate due to a condition that never becomes false.

```java
while (true) {
    // endless loop
}
```

---

## 🧠 Common Pitfall: Off-by-One Errors

Be careful with loop conditions using `<`, `<=`, etc.

```java
for (int i = 0; i <= 5; i++) { // runs 6 times: 0 to 5
```

---

## 🔂 Nested Loops

A loop inside another loop, often used with 2D arrays.

```java
for (int row = 0; row < 3; row++) {
    for (int col = 0; col < 3; col++) {
        System.out.println("[" + row + "," + col + "]");
    }
}
```

---

## ⛔ Loop Control Statements

- `break` — exits the loop
- `continue` — skips the current iteration

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    if (i % 2 == 0) continue;
    System.out.print(i + " "); // prints odd numbers
}
```

## 🧪 Practice Multiple Choice (5 Questions)

**1. What will the following code print?**
```java
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    System.out.print(i + " ");
}
```
(A) 0 1 2  
(B) 1 2 3  
(C) 0 1 2 3  
(D) 1 2  
✅ **Answer: (A)**

---

**2. How many times will this loop run?**
```java
for (int i = 0; i <= 4; i++) {
    System.out.println("Loop");
}
```
(A) 4  
(B) 5  
(C) 6  
(D) Infinite  
✅ **Answer: (B)**

---

**3. What is true about a `do-while` loop?**  
(A) It may never run  
(B) It always runs at least once  
(C) It always runs exactly once  
(D) It runs forever  
✅ **Answer: (B)**

---

**4. Which loop will print all even numbers from 0 to 10?**
```java
for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i += 2)
    System.out.println(i);
```
(A) Correct  
(B) Skips 0  
(C) Prints odd numbers  
(D) Infinite loop  
✅ **Answer: (A)**

---

**5. What does `continue` do in a loop?**  
(A) Ends the loop  
(B) Restarts the loop  
(C) Skips the current iteration  
(D) Pauses the loop  
✅ **Answer: (C)**
