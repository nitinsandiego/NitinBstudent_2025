# People I talked to

## Our Booth
- **Isabel Marilla**
    - She presented toolkit and explaiend the different featueres of toolkit. Since I helped create this project, I felt proud for our work to be showcased at the expo.
- **Aidan Lau**
    - I saw my friends projects, Gamify. He showed me the project and he demoed it for me. He also let me play the game, and I was really impressed with the game.

## Other Booths
- Optix Robotics - I saw a few of friends in the club and talked to them about their recent competitions.
- DECA - I also saw many friends and talked to them about what goes into being successful in DECA.
- I also participated in a experiment from Honors Medical Interventions, which was really fun.
- I also saw a botany booth and they were giving out plants. I took a tomato plant and actually planted it in my backyard. I am really excited to see how it grows.
- I also got the opportunity to wear actual fire fighter gear. It was really heavy and I learned that it is really hard to move in the gear.

# Reflection
- I really enjoyed the expo. I was able to see many of my friends and their projects. I also got to see many of the clubs at our school and in different schools around the district and what they do. I was really impressed with the amount of work that goes into each project. I also learned a lot about the different clubs and what they do. I am really excited to see how my tomato plant grows.
