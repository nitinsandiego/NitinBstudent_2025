# Objectives

- **Clean up tables from Trimester 1 work and Trimester 2 work**
    - Most of my previous' teams work is still in the repository, so I will need to remove that
    - I will need to also remove any relations with our `Student` table with other tables to not mess up anything
- **Help Tarun with UI and help him test UI**
    - Tarun has been working on UI, and I will need to help him with that and also help him test the UI
    - Integrate and create just one navbar
        - Reduces complications from many different submenus
- **Talk with other people in my team and determine if their previous code is still relevant**
    - A lot of Sharon's, Eshaan's, and Kayden's old code is still in the repository, and I will need their help to determine if it is still relevant
        - If it is not relevant, I will need to remove it, so that we can have a clean repository
