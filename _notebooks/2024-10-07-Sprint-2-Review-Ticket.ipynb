    "### Unit 1: **Primitive Types**\n",
    "- **Attributes of the `Student` class**: \n",
    "  - `int` for `studentID`\n",
    "  - `double` for `gpa`\n",
    "  - These data types are basic building blocks in Java, representing integer and floating-point numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unit 2: **Using Objects**\n",
    "- **String for the `name` attribute**: \n",
    "  - `String` is a class that represents textual data.\n",
    "- **Using `Scanner`**: \n",
    "  - A `Scanner` object is used for user input.\n",
    "- **Creating Objects**:\n",
    "  - `StudentManagementSystem` and `Student` objects are instantiated to manage and store student data.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Unit 3: **Boolean Expressions and if Statements**\n",
    "- **Searching and Deleting Students by ID**: \n",
    "  - Uses `if` statements to check if a student's `studentID` matches the input, and to verify valid choices in the menu.\n",
    "  - Boolean expressions evaluate equality in conditions like `student.getStudentID() == studentID`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unit 4: **Iteration**\n",
    "- **Displaying, Searching, and Deleting Students**: \n",
    "  - `for-each` loop is used to iterate through the `ArrayList` of students.\n",
    "  - The `removeIf()` method, combined with a lambda expression, iterates over the list to remove a student.\n",
    "  - Iteration also occurs in the menu to continuously prompt the user for input until they choose to exit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unit 5: **Writing Classes**\n",
    "- **`Student` Class**:\n",
    "  - Contains attributes (`name`, `studentID`, `gpa`), a constructor, and methods like `getName()`, `getStudentID()`, and `getGpa()`.\n",
    "  - This encapsulation allows you to work with student data in a well-organized way.\n",
    "- **Overriding `toString()`**:\n",
    "  - The `toString()` method in `Student` is overridden to provide a readable string representation of a student’s information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unit 7: **ArrayList**\n",
    "- **Storing Student Objects**:\n",
    "  - An `ArrayList<Student>` is used to dynamically store and manage the list of students, providing flexibility in terms of adding, searching, and removing students.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unit 10: **Recursion**\n",
    "- **Calculating Average GPA**:\n",
    "  - A recursive method, `calculateAverageGPA(int index)`, computes the average GPA by adding the GPA of each student and dividing by the total number of students.\n",
    "  - This demonstrates the use of recursion to break down a complex problem into simpler, smaller steps."
